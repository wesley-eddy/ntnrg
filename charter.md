# Non-Terrestrial Networking Research Group (NTNRG)

The Non-Terrestrial Networking Research Group (NTNRG) is chartered to
research the architectural, protocol design, and operational implications
of networking among connectivity-challenged nodes, specifically: networking
among nodes with highly dynamic connectivity imposed by virtue of their
non-terrestrial deployment environment. This includes High Altitude Platforms
(HAPS), typically in the stratosphere, satellites in Low, Mid, and
Geosynchronous orbits (VLEO, LEO, MEO, GEO), as well as platforms outside Earth orbit,
including (but not limited to) lunar and other planetary surfaces and orbits,
Lagrange points, etc.

Previous research work (DTNRG) focused on the delay and disruption tolerance
required to communicate effectively in extreme connectivity-challenged
scenarios (vis. RFC 4838). Since that time, network nodes on aerospace
platforms in the LEO regime have seen a rapid rise in deployment and
scale. This regime poses less extreme time constraints on connectivity, but
the rapidity of change and variability of topologies that might be built
among nodes moving through this environment present new challenges.

The intended work products of the NTNRG include evaluation of the impact to
inter-networking among NTN nodes imposed by these deployments as well as
possible mitigation of adverse effects. Of specific
interest are:

  * simulation, measurement, or testing techniques that are particularly
    well suited for NTNs,
  * metrics and performance evaluation techniques and methodologies,
  * the impact to transport protocols as paths experience normal changes
    in characteristics like latency, jitter, and loss associated with
    nominal platform behavior,
  * effective security mechanisms and techniques,
  * routing and addressing approaches,
  * proposals for scalable, stable routing or network orchestration
    strategies in such a dynamic environment, and
  * ideas on whether and how traffic engineering may be optimally
    employed.

NTNRG may also consider the implications of and requirements for NTN nodes
from different administrative domains dynamically forming connectivity.
The control plane requirements and trust model design parameters are
especially relevant.

The work in the NTNRG may include proposed changes to IETF protocols or their
operation. Providing recommendations to the IETF is not an objective of this
RG, so standardization of any such changes is deferred to the appropriate
working groups within the IETF.
